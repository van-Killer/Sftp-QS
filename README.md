▌ 🛠️ Workflow (Step-by-step)

▌ Step 1. Checking and Installing the OpenSSH Server Package

The script first verifies that the OpenSSH.Server package is present in the system. If missing, it will be automatically installed.

▌ Step 2. Verifying and Starting the SSHD Service

Next, the script ensures that the sshd service is running. If stopped, it starts the service.

▌ Step 3. Setting Up Automatic Startup for SSHD

If automatic startup hasn't been enabled yet, this step enables it so that the service runs after each reboot.

▌ Step 4. Firewall Configuration

The script adds necessary firewall rules to ensure uninterrupted communication over SFTP ports.

▌ Step 5. Creating a Dedicated User Account

Finally, the script creates a new user account intended solely for secure file transfer via SFTP.
